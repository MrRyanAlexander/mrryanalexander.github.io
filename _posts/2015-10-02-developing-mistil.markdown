I have been using dating sites and apps since before there was such a thing. In the early days of the web, not to be confused with the computer, some of us were using local chatrooms as a form of dating. Those days are long gone, but not because of a lack of interest, it was the crazy spam bots. Today, that is starting to be a problem again, but with fake user account bots on dating sites. That isn't even the worst of it though. Let me ask you something, do you want to pay for a dating app that has profiles for people who downloaded the app and removed it? I am going to share a person experience with you, please avoid throwing the tomatoes until the end. 

I have accounts on POF, OKCupid, Tinder and Clover. I also have Facebook, Snapchat, and the one app I never ever chat with anyone on, but cannot seem to find the desire to remove, Kik. Maybe I am waiting for someone to Kik me, who the F knows. The point is I am far from being fullfilled by the dating apps in this group, but the one app I do love and we all use it everyday is Facebook. I can get on Facebook anytime and find random stuff friends post so fast I can never read it all. That's why I love it and why I imagine most of the world, if not all of it, will still be using Facebook in 2050 and beyond. It is current and it is always relevant to something I care about or hate enough to comment about. 
Why can't dating be like that? If I go out to a bar there is always something relevant and I can see who is there. If it's empty I bounce and head to the next joint. 

When I try out a new dating app, I get all excited when there are hundreds to thousands of girls near me who I can scroll through and send messages to. When don't see very many profiles, I cancel my account and delete the app. Unfortunately, in both cases I might as well have just spent a few bucks and went to the bar to find someone for a date. The chances that I will get a reply are about 1 in 50. That sucks if you ask me, but I'm not done yet. We haven't factored in whether or not those messages I sent to the 49 girls who never replied can ever be opened. Why, because they might have deleted the app already or get on so infrequently that my message will be downed. 

I am sick and tired of wasting my time searching through dating profiles for a girl who seems like she is really interested in dating someone. Even when the apps says she is online or has been online in the past 3 days, our chances of making contact are slim. That's when I starting thinking about Facebook and what keeps bring me back to it. This is also a good time to mention Clover, because Clover made me really, really mad. I thought it was the first real social dating app, but as it turns out, it is just another screen of empty promises. Sure it might look nice, but who cares since it's not actually social. Building an app that sends messages and lets people post pictures does not in anyway qualify as social. Building an app that tricks me into thinking girls are posting dates, only to find out that a so called date is just like another kiss, wink, like or one line message. What a waste of investing dollars you people in the valley can be. 

Let's stay relevant. Let's stay current. And when we aren't looking for someone to date right now or very soon, soon as in this week, let's remove the focus from that and keep things relevant. This is why I am building the app I am calling Mistil. 

Mistil is my pet project and it seeks to be the Dating App that people use to find someone now, not next week, not next month and not after sending out 50+ messages. Mistil is actually a social dating app. It is being designed specifically for people who are only interested in finding dates right now or very soon. That being said, it is focused on the simplest approaches ever imagined in dating and by removing all of the traditional option barriers, it is the first social dating app.
